# AD9833 Library for Arduino

This library allows an Arduino board to control an AD9833 Programmable Waveform Generator.

Designed specifically to work with an AD9833 Breakou like the one below:

However, there is an option to set a custom MCLK frequency.

These chips use SPI to communicate so 3 pins are required to interface.
